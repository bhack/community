## Rationale for Migration
* What are the use cases for the addon?
* OSS usage, H5 Index, etc.

## Historical Information
* Have there been signifiant issues reported to Addons that need to be adressed?
* When was it implemented in Addons?

## Implementation Details
* Link to implementation in Addons:
* Does this include custom-op kernels?
    * Are they CPU/GPU/TPU compatible?
* What is the pytest coverage of the addon?

## Changes to Implementation (If Needed)
```

* Discussion on the rationale for changes

## Transition Plan
* Proposed landing place in tf-core
* Deprecation plan for Addons
    * Will we be able to alias the core implementation? (parameters must be exact match)

## Final Decision
TBD
